The purpose of this project is to get started and get acquainted with image and video processing using the OpenCV free library.

The following tasks should be performed in the form of a program on the test image and the test video. The results of the different steps must be displayed consecutively and a key must be received from the keyboard to receive the result of each step:

The test.jpg image file is read and displayed from the input.
 From the three color channels of the image, the blue color channel is separated and displayed.
 Convert the input image to a gray image and display it.
 The gray surface image is displayed using a smoothed Gaussian filter and the smoothed image.
 The input image is rotated to 90 degrees and displayed.
 Resize the image (halve its height and halve its width) and display it.
 The edges of the image are detected and displayed.
 The input image is segmented and the result is displayed.
 Identify the faces in the image and draw a rectangle at the location of each face.
 The test.avi video file is read and the first five frames are displayed in 0.5 seconds interval, respectively.
